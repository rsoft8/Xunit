Before you file a bug...

* Is this a question? Ask it on our [Slack server](https://xunit.slack.com/). Not a member? It's easy to [sign up(https://xunit-slackin.herokuapp.com/).
* Is this a bug with VSTest (aka Visual Studio Test Explorer, `dotnet test`, `dotnet vstest`, or `vstest.console.exe`)? Open those issues here: https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/
* Did you search [the documentation](https://xunit.github.io/)?
* Did you search the issues list to see if someone already reported it? When looking for duplicates, make sure to look through open **and** closed issues.
* Did you create a simple repro for the problem? Bugs without repro projects will be automatically closed.
