	/// Used to decorate xUnit.net test classes and collections to indicate a test which has

	/// the first test in the class is run (including <see cref="IAsyncLifetime.InitializeAsync"/>
	/// if it's implemented). After all the tests in the test class have been run, it is cleaned up
	/// by calling <see cref="IAsyncDisposable.DisposeAsync"/> if it's implemented, or it falls back
	/// to <see cref="IDisposable.Dispose"/> if that's implemented. Class fixtures may have
	/// a public constructor which is either empty, or accepts one or more assembly and/or collection
	/// fixture objects as constructor arguments. To gain access to the fixture data from inside the
	/// test, a constructor argument should be added to the test class which/ exactly matches the
	/// <typeparamref name="TFixture"/>.
